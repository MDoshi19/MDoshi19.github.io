      <h1>Hi, I’m <span class="highlight">Manank</span>!</h1>
      <p>I'm a sophomore at UC Berkeley studying Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering. If there's one thing you need to know about me, it's that I love space, from galaxies to rockets to planets and everything in between. 
      At UC Berkeley, I am part of two clubs on the UC Berkeley campus, <a href="https://stars.studentorg.berkeley.edu/">Space Technologies and Rocketry (STAR) </a> and <a href="https://stac.studentorg.berkeley.edu/">Space Technologies at Cal (STAC)</a>. As part of STAR, I am the Vice President, handling
      launches, managing team documentation and reports, and running the club to make sure our rockets launch perfectly. I also do a lot of technical work, from CADding much of the rocket, to making simulations for rocket descent, to building the hardware for our liquid rocket. For STAC, I am the mechanical lead for a project called Lunar Hopper, aiming to build a robot that uses hopping
      as its primary way for locomotive motion to traverse difficult terrains that rovers and other vehicles can not access. I am currently part of the course staff for Engineering 7, Berkeley's Introduction to Programming course for engineers. I also previously conducted research and data analysis in cosmology at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab with the <a href = "https://www.desi.lbl.gov/">Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)</a> under Dr. Allyson Brodzeller on Damped Lyman-alpha Absorbers (DLAs).
      I also volunteer with <a href="https://soinc.org/">Science Olympiad </a> as part of the National A-Team, assisting with space science events, especially Astronomy. I primarily write tests and help supervise the space science events at tournaments.
      </p>
