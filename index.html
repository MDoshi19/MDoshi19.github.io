      <h1>Hi, I’m <span class="highlight">Manank</span>!</h1>
      <p>I'm a sophomore at UC Berkeley studying Astrophysics and Physics. If there's one thing you need to know about me, it's that I love space, from galaxies to rockets to planets and everything in between.
      I am currently conducting research in cosmology with the <a href = "https://www.desi.lbl.gov/">Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)</a> under Dr. Allyson Brodzeller on Damped Lyman-Alpha (DLA) systems. <be> 
      Along with astrophysical research, I am part of two clubs on the UC Berkeley campus, <a href="https://stars.studentorg.berkeley.edu/">Space Technologies and Rocketry (STAR) </a> and <a href="https://stac.studentorg.berkeley.edu/">Space Technologies at Cal (STAC)</a>. As part of STAR, I am the operations lead, handling
      the logistics for launches, ensuring safety among club members, and compiling all team documentation and reports. I am also a member of the recovery subteam, ensuring proper landing of the rocket. For STAC, I am the mechanical lead for a project called Lunar Hopper, aiming to build a robot that uses hopping
      as its primary way for locomotive motion to traverse difficult terrains that rovers and other vehicles can not access.<br>
      I also volunteer with <a href="https://soinc.org/">Science Olympiad </a> as part of the Nationals A-Team, assisting with space science events, especially Astronomy. I primarily write tests and help supervise the space science events at tournaments.
