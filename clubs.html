      <h2>Space Technologies and Rocketry (STAR)</h2>
      <p>STAR is a rocketry club focused on building rockets every year for competitions. In the past, we've used plenty of solid motors, but this upcoming year, we hope to launch a liquid engine (Fuel: Kerosene, Oxidizer: Liquid Oxygen) rocket at a competition. 
      On STAR, I am the operations lead and a recovery engineer. As the operations lead, I am in charge of the safety, launches, and documentation of the team. On the recovery team, I help ensure the rocket lands softly in a re-flyable and mostly undamaged state.
      This means that the load and shock are properly distributed along the rocket and its parachutes through research, rigorous testing, and multiple test flights. Along with this, we utilize black powder and avionics (aviation electronics) to ensure optimal deployment of 
      the parachutes.</p>

      <h2>Space Technologies at Cal (STAC)</h2>
      <p>STAC is a large team with 5 separate engineering projects going on at the same time, but all are dedicated towards learning about and exploring space. </p>
