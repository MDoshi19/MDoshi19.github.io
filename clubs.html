  <h1>Clubs!</h1>
  <div>
  <p>Academics are awesome, but what's even more fun for me is applying what I've learned in classes to practical projects with people who have similar goals.</p>

      <h2>Space Technologies and Rocketry (STAR)</h2>
      <p>STAR is a rocketry club focused on building rockets every year for competitions. In the past, we've used plenty of solid motors, but this upcoming year, we hope to launch a liquid engine (Fuel: Kerosene, Oxidizer: Liquid Oxygen) rocket at a competition. 
      On STAR, I am the operations lead and a recovery engineer. As the operations lead, I am in charge of the safety, launches, and documentation of the team. On the recovery team, I help ensure the rocket lands softly in a re-flyable and mostly undamaged state.
      This means that the load and shock are properly distributed along the rocket and its parachutes through research, rigorous testing, and multiple test flights. Along with this, we utilize black powder and avionics (aviation electronics) to ensure optimal deployment of 
      the parachutes.</p>

      <h2>Space Technologies at Cal (STAC)</h2>
      <p>STAC is a large team with 5 separate engineering projects going on at the same time. Each project is a small team, and my team is the Lunar Hopper team. As the Mechanical Lead on the project, I lead the development of a robot that "hops" around various
      terrains. Many lunar missions and other extraterrestrial missions have struggled to properly map the surface of bodies in our solar system due to the risk of getting stuck in craters. The 3-legged robot, named Leapfrog, compresses carbon-fiber cables using a one-way bearing. When released, the cables push 
      down and cause the hopper to jump. The legs can reposition the angle of the robot to allow it to move in different directions. The software and hardware in the head of the robot allow it to create a 3-dimensional map of the surrounding area. Ultimately, we hope to build a cheap, easily replicable that can 
      be used to explore regions on the Moon and beyond.</p>
